# Test plan

## List of classes

* List below all classes in your implementation that should have unit tests.
* For each class, list methods that can be tested in isolation.
* For each class, if there are conditions on the class' behaviour that cannot
  be tested by calling one method in isolation, give at least one example of
  a test for such a condition.

Do **not** include in your test plan the `Marrakech` class or the predefined
static methods for which we have already provided unit tests.
