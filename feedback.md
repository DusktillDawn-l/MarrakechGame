c5: There are very limited instructions about the game play.

c6: The game play is buggy for 2 players.

c8: very limited AI functions, the documents are also insufficient.

c12: May separate the AI function.

c13: The quality of comments is inconsistent across code blocks/functions/classes. Good job, but some of the key logics are unclear from the limited comments.

c18: Code flexibility is limited, lacks polished experience for the user playing the game. e.g. with invalid moves, you may give why it is invalid, and suggest how to make it valid.
